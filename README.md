## [FE Coding Challenge]

This front-end challenge is designed for you to showcase your abilities, and demonstrate what you would consider to be production ready code.  

### Before you start

- There are no time constraints. `(Submission date should be confirmed with your main point of contact)`   
- There are no restrictions on the tech stack but Vue.js is preferred   
- The wireframe design, provided below is just for guidance. You are free to use it, or to introduce a suitable alternative instead.
- You should have been provided with a link to an empty repository on github, and should have permission to clone, and push changes to it. 

### Requirements

- Must be responsive, supporting both desktop & mobile.  
- Welcome to consume [this API endpoint](https://gc-frontendchallenge-2019.azurewebsites.net/api/EasyMode) for data or mock data yourself.  
- Each quote should be displayed as a 'card'.  
- Must align with _your_ definition of production ready code.  
- App must work, and look as expected in all major browsers on both desktop & mobile.  
- Test must be written when appropriate

### Task

Build a simple app which consumes, handles and displays data served from an API, with a UI reflecting either the provided wireframe, or a suitable alternative.  

Please include any additional material, if you feel it may:
- Assist our understanding of your submission
- Support any technical considerations that you've made
- Support any technical decisions that you've made

It is expected that we can build your solution. If you think it will assist, please provide the appropriate build instructions.  

### Submission

When complete, please push your code to the github repository that was provided to you alongside this challenge.  
If you experience trouble doing this, please get in touch with your main point of contact for alternative submission methods.
